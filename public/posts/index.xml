      <description>I recently moved my blog to Hugo from Jekyll. My main motivation was that previously having experience with other static site generators such as Pelican and Jekyll, I wanted to give the newest one a try. Other reasons to try Hugo is that it&amp;rsquo;s written in Golang which is supposed to be fast, and that I liked some of the Hugo themes I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with static site generators, they serve as frameworks for building websites and blogs.</description>
