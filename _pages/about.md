Hello and welcome to my personal site. I'm currently a data scientist at Scotiabank,
living in Toronto ON. I currently hold a Master's of Science in Computer Science and
a Bachelor's of Science in Physics.

During my undergrad, I did a couple of NERC funded projects in mathematical models
for aggregation, mainly [collective behaviour of biological aggregation]() and
[opinion dynamics](). I then got interested in the field of big data problems,
which then led me to the field of machine learning. Naturally loving problem
solving, I enrolled in the Professional Master's in Big Data program at
Simon Fraser Univeristy.
