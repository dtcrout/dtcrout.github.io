I'm currently a data scientist at Scotiabank based in Toronto, Ontario. I have
a MSc in Computer Science and BSc in Physics.

During my undergrad, I got involved in mathematical models for biological aggregation
and opinion dynamics in which I solved differential equations using Monte Carlo methods.
This got me interested in big data problems, then later to the field of machine learning.
Naturally loving math and problem solving, I enrolled in the [Professional Master's Program in Big Data](https://www.sfu.ca/bigdata)
at Simon Fraser University. There I gained [the skills necessary](https://vimeo.com/191054268)
to pursue a career in data science.

Here are some things I also grok:
* Music
* DIY
* Linux and Emacs
* Mechanical Keyboards
