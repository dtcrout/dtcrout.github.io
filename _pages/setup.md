I'm interested in the [gear other people use](https://usesthis.com/) to get their work done.
If you're at all curious, here's my personal setup:

### Lenovo Thinkpad x220

The last Thinkpad series to have the classical keyboard. I use this computer as my
daily driver. On it I have Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installed with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/)
which is a lightweight and minimal window manager. For additional productivity,
I use the Chrome extension [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) which brings
Vim controls to the browser. My dotfiles are also hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dtcrout/dotfiles).
