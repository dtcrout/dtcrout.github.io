I'm interested in the [gear other people use](https://usesthis.com/) to get their work done.
If you're at all curious, here's my personal setup:

### Lenovo Thinkpad x220

The last Thinkpad series to have the classical keyboard. I use this computer as my
daily driver. On it I have Ubuntu 16.04 LTS installed with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/)
which is a lightweight and minimal window manager. For additional productivity,
I use the Chrome extension [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) which brings
Vim controls to the browser. My dotfiles are also hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dtcrout/dotfiles).

### Happy Hacking Professional 2

The Happy Hacking Professional 2 is a Japanese 60% layout keyboard with [Topre](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Topre_switch)
switches. It's portable and extremely pleasant to type on (and listen to).
The layout differs from traditional keyboards as the escape and backspace keys are
shifted one row down. The control keys are also removed from their usual position.
Instead the caps lock key is remapped as a control key. This makes the keyboard
ergonomic and Emacs keyboard bindings not a one-way ticket RSI-city.
