My background is in physics and applied mathematics. I have a BSc in Physics
and now I'm pursuing a MSc in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University
in the [Professional Master's Program in Big Data](https://www.sfu.ca/bigdata).
I currently reside in Toronto working as a full-time data scientist at Scotiabank.

I'm a big fan of knowing [what other people use](https://usesthis.com/)
to get work done. Here's my current setup:

* Lenovo Thinkpad x220
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/)
* [Happy Hacking Keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hacking_Keyboard)

Here are some things I grok:

* Linux
* Emacs
* Tiling window managers
* Mechanical keyboards
* [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/)

My dotfiles can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dtcrout/dotfiles).
