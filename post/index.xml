      <description>I watch a lot of YouTube. In fact a lot of younger people watch more YouTube then they do television. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, YouTube not only acts as an endless source of entertainment but it also serves as a source of knowledge and information.

I&amp;rsquo;ve also been wanting to redo my personal blog for quite some time, but never did because I would always get bogged down on choosing a theme. While browsing for site themes, I came across Simple Hugo Theme which is a Hugo theme inspired by http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.</description>
