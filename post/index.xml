      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re at work one day, when your boss approaches you with a peculiar task.
&amp;ldquo;Open your email. I sent you a piece of code&amp;rdquo;, he says. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s another team who wrote it and they say it takes days to run&amp;hellip; They have no idea why though&amp;rdquo;.
You go to your terminal and open the file in your text editor. The file opens and you take a quick glimpse of the code.</description>

      <description>What do you do on vacation? Do you relax on a nice, hot sunny beach sipping on an ice cool drink? Do you travel across South East Asia with a loved one eating new and delicious foods? Perhaps you enjoy adventuring and hiking in the great, beautiful Swiss Alps? Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re more like me, someone who is at home catching up on their machine learning papers. One paper in particular caught my full attention: CNM: An Interpretable Complex-valued network for Matching by Qiuchi Li, Benyou Wang and Massimo Melucci.</description>

      <description>I watch a lot of YouTube. In fact, a lot of younger people watch more YouTube than they watch television. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, YouTube is not only an endless source of entertainment, but it also serves as a source of knowledge and information. The platform has videos on just about anything from how to make your own fermented food, cracking the Sega Saturn or Joe Rogan interviewing himself. However, if you have been on the platform for as long as I have, you have probably caught on by now just how much clickbait YouTube creators use.</description>

      <description>As of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting interested in software philosophies such as the Unix philosophy and Suckless, hoping that they will provide me with some guidance on how to become a better programmer. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been wanting to redo my personal blog for quite some time, but never did because I would always get bogged down on choosing a theme. While browsing for site themes, I came across Simple Hugo Theme which is a Hugo theme inspired by http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.</description>
