      <description>&amp;ldquo;Life moves pretty fast. If you don&amp;rsquo;t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.&amp;rdquo;
In Ferris Buller&amp;rsquo;s Day Off, our young philosopher turns to the audience and tells us we should stop and take a moment to reflect on what&amp;rsquo;s going on around us. He wants us to ask ourselves: are we living authentically? &amp;hellip;And he&amp;rsquo;s right. When was the last time you took a moment to reflect on what was going on in your life?</description>

      <description>Data leaks happen. With the ever-growing multitude of software-based services we use in the everydayness, our usage of Internet of Things-things, to the ready-to-hand rewards systems on our phones, our personal data is out there in the world. As such, our data has a greater chance of leaking and getting into places we don&amp;rsquo;t want it to end up.
As data scientists and machine learning developers, we should be taking measures to prevent sensitive information (such as credentials or customer data) from leaking out of our projects.</description>

      <description>Imagine the following scenario:
You&amp;rsquo;re at work one day, when your boss approaches you with a peculiar task.
&amp;ldquo;Open your email. I sent you a piece of code&amp;rdquo;, he says. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s another team who wrote it and they say it takes days to run&amp;hellip; They have no idea why though&amp;rdquo;.
You go to your terminal and open the file in your text editor. The file opens and you take a quick glimpse of the code.</description>

      <description>What do you do on vacation? Do you relax on a nice, hot sunny beach sipping on an ice cool drink? Do you travel across South East Asia with a loved one eating new and delicious foods? Perhaps you enjoy adventuring and hiking in the great, beautiful Swiss Alps? Or maybe you&amp;rsquo;re more like me, someone who is at home catching up on their machine learning papers. One paper in particular caught my full attention: CNM: An Interpretable Complex-valued network for Matching by Qiuchi Li, Benyou Wang and Massimo Melucci.</description>

      <title>Generating YouTube Titles Using Image Captioning</title>

      <description>I watch a lot of YouTube. In fact, a lot of younger people watch more YouTube than they watch television. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, YouTube is not only an endless source of entertainment, but it also serves as a source of knowledge and information. The platform has videos on just about anything from how to make your own fermented food, cracking the Sega Saturn or Joe Rogan interviewing himself. However, if you have been on the platform for as long as I have, you have probably caught on by now just how much clickbait YouTube creators use.</description>

      <description>As of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting interested in software philosophies such as the Unix philosophy and Suckless, hoping that they will provide me with some guidance on how to become a better programmer. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been wanting to redo my personal blog for quite some time, but never did because I would always get bogged down on choosing a theme. While browsing for site themes, I came across Simple Hugo Theme which is a Hugo theme inspired by http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a data scientist at Scotiabank based in Toronto, Ontario. I have a MSc in Computer Science and BSc in Physics.
During my undergrad, I got involved in mathematical models for biological aggregation and opinion dynamics in which I solved differential equations using Monte Carlo methods. This got me interested in big data problems in addition to the field of machine learning. Naturally loving math and problem solving, I enrolled in the Professional Master&amp;rsquo;s program in Big Data at Simon Fraser University.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the gear other people use to get their work done. If you&amp;rsquo;re at all curious, here&amp;rsquo;s my personal setup:
Lenovo ThinkPad x220 ðŸ’» The xx20 ThinkPad series is the last one to have the classical keyboard. I use this computer as my daily driver. I run Ubuntu LTS as my primary OS, switching between different window managers. For development I use tmux and Spacemacs. My dotfiles are hosted on GitHub.</description>
