      <description>As of late, I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting interested in software philosophies such as the Unix philosophy and Suckless, hoping that they will provide me with some guidance on how to become a better programmer. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been wanting to redo my personal blog for quite some time, but never did because I would always get bogged down on choosing a theme. While browsing for site themes, I came across Simple Hugo Theme which is a Hugo theme inspired by http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a data scientist at Scotiabank based in Toronto, Ontario. I have a MSc in Computer Science and BSc in Physics.
During my undergrad, I got involved in mathematical models for biological aggregation and opinion dynamics in which I solved differential equations using Monte Carlo methods. This got me interested in big data problems in addition to the field of machine learning. Naturally loving math and problem solving, I enrolled in the Professional Master&amp;rsquo;s program in Big Data at Simon Fraser University.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the gear other people use to get their work done. If you&amp;rsquo;re at all curious, here&amp;rsquo;s my personal setup:
Lenovo ThinkPad x220 The xx20 ThinkPad series is the last one to have the classical keyboard. I use this computer as my daily driver. I run Ubuntu LTS as my primary OS, switching between different window managers. For development I use tmux and Spacemacs. My dotfiles are hosted on GitHub.</description>
